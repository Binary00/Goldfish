# Goldfish
The goldfish is a Pro Micro compatible microcontroller designed for use in Mechanical Keyboards, although it is perfectly suited for any hobby electronics project.
It is based on the same ATMega32U4 IC as regular Pro Micros so can be programmed with the Arduino IDE, or keyboard firmwares like TMK, QMK, etc.

## Advantages
* Through-hole USB connector breaks much less easily
* Mid-mounted USB connector makes the board a lot thinner
* Super cool reversible USB-C connector
* Pin-compatible with Pro Micros
* Five extra pins available along the bottom edge of the board for larger hand-wired builds
* USB data lines are easily accessible through two internal pins

## Disadvantages
* Fewer custom cable options compared to USB Mini-B/Micro-B
* More expensive (depends on quantity ordered though)
* No onboard voltage regulator (won't make a difference for keyboards, can be an issue for other electronics projects)
